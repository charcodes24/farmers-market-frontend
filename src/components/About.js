            <h3>Hi.. we're happy you're here. While our farmer's market is still open, with our regular scheduled, weekly events and food trucks appearances, we wanted to provide people a means to place orders with their favorite vendors and pick up their orders at a scheduled time on Saturday. Just cause some people want to social distance, doesn't mean you should miss out on your favorite goods! Just login and create an order and pick up your order at the designated tent during the time </h3>
